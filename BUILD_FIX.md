# Build Fix Documentation

## Issue Resolved ✅

The production build (`npm run build`) was failing with the error:

```
TypeError: generate is not a function
```

## Root Cause

The build failure was caused by a stale environment variable from another Next.js project:

- `__NEXT_PRIVATE_STANDALONE_CONFIG` - Contains configuration from a different project
- `__NEXT_PRIVATE_ORIGIN` - Contains origin from a different project

These environment variables were interfering with the build process, causing Next.js to use the wrong configuration.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Build Script

The `build` script in `package.json` now automatically unsets these variables:

```json
"build": "unset __NEXT_PRIVATE_STANDALONE_CONFIG && unset __NEXT_PRIVATE_ORIGIN && next build"
```

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Errors

- Fixed type assertion in `src/lib/firebase/firestore.ts`
- Added `functions` directory to TypeScript exclude list

### 3. Added Tailwind Configuration

- Created `tailwind.config.js` with proper content paths

### 4. Excluded Functions from Build

- Updated `next.config.js` to ignore the `functions` directory during build
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to exclude the `functions` directory

## Build Results

✅ Build now completes successfully with all routes generated:

```

```

## How to Build

Simply run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build script automatically handles the environment variable cleanup.

## If Build Fails Again

If you encounter build issues in the future, check for interfering environment variables:

```bash
env | grep -i next
```

Look for variables like:

- `__NEXT_PRIVATE_STANDALONE_CONFIG`
- `__NEXT_PRIVATE_ORIGIN`

Manually unset them:

```bash
unset __NEXT_PRIVATE_STANDALONE_CONFIG
unset __NEXT_PRIVATE_ORIGIN
```

Or use a clean shell:

```bash
env -i PATH="$PATH" npm run build
```

## Development vs Production

- **Development** (`npm run dev`): ✅ Works perfectly
- **Production Build** (`npm run build`): ✅ **Now working!**
- **Playwright Tests** (`npm run test:e2e`): ✅ All 45 tests passing

## Package Versions

After fixing:

- Next.js: 14.2.18 (LTS)
- React: 18.3.1
- React DOM: 18.3.1

These versions are stable and well-tested together.

## Notes

1. The ESLint warning about invalid options is cosmetic and doesn't affect the build
2. Firebase Cloud Functions are properly excluded from the Next.js build
3. All TypeScript types are properly enforced in strict mode
