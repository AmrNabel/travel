# Execute BASE PRP with Validation

Implement a feature using the PRP file with comprehensive checking and validation.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Load and Analyze PRP**
   - Read the specified PRP file completely
   - Parse all context, requirements, and specifications
   - Identify all deliverables and acceptance criteria
   - Follow all instructions in the PRP and extend research if needed
   - Ensure complete understanding of all requirements
   - Perform additional web searches and codebase exploration as needed

2. **PRP Compliance Check**
   - Create a comprehensive checklist of ALL PRP requirements
   - Map each requirement to implementation tasks
   - Identify any ambiguities or missing specifications
   - Cross-reference with existing codebase patterns and standards
   - Document any assumptions or clarifications needed

3. **ULTRATHINK Planning**
   - Analyze current implementation state vs PRP requirements
   - Identify what is already implemented correctly
   - Identify what is implemented incorrectly and needs fixing
   - Identify what is missing and needs implementation
   - Create a comprehensive implementation plan addressing ALL gaps
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use TodoWrite tool to create and track the complete implementation plan
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code to follow

4. **Gap Analysis and Remediation**
   - **Audit Current State:**
     - Compare existing implementation against PRP specifications
     - Document discrepancies, missing features, and incorrect implementations
     - Prioritize fixes based on criticality and dependencies
   - **Fix Incorrect Implementations:**
     - Correct any code that doesn't match PRP specifications exactly
     - Update configurations, parameters, or logic as needed
     - Ensure architectural compliance with PRP design requirements
   - **Implement Missing Features:**
     - Build all unimplemented functionality specified in the PRP
     - Follow established patterns and coding standards
     - Ensure integration with existing systems

5. **Execute Implementation Plan**
   - Implement ALL required code changes systematically
   - Follow the PRP specifications exactly - no deviations
   - Maintain consistency with existing codebase architecture
   - Document implementation decisions and rationale

6. **Comprehensive Validation**
   - **PRP Compliance Validation:**
     - Verify each PRP requirement is fully implemented
     - Check that implementation matches PRP specifications exactly
     - Validate all acceptance criteria are met
   - **Technical Validation:**
     - Run all validation commands specified in PRP
     - Execute comprehensive test suite
     - Perform integration testing
     - Validate error handling and edge cases
   - **Fix and Retry Loop:**
     - Address any validation failures immediately
     - Use error patterns specified in PRP for troubleshooting
     - Re-run validation until ALL tests pass
     - Document and resolve any persistent issues

7. **Final Compliance Verification**
   - **Complete PRP Re-review:**
     - Re-read the entire PRP from start to finish
     - Verify every single requirement has been implemented
     - Confirm no specifications were missed or misinterpreted
   - **Checklist Validation:**
     - Ensure all checklist items are completed
     - Verify all deliverables meet quality standards
     - Confirm all documentation is complete and accurate
   - **Final Validation Suite:**
     - Run complete validation suite one final time
     - Perform end-to-end testing
     - Validate performance and security requirements

8. **Completion Report**
   - Generate comprehensive completion status report
   - Document all implemented features and fixes
   - Report any deviations (with justification) from original PRP
   - Provide evidence of successful validation
   - Confirm 100% PRP compliance achievement

## Continuous Reference Protocol

- Reference the PRP file throughout the entire process
- Cross-check implementation decisions against PRP specifications
- When in doubt, prioritize PRP requirements over assumptions
- Maintain traceability from PRP requirements to implementation

## Quality Gates

- No step proceeds until the previous step is fully validated
- All PRP requirements must be explicitly addressed
- Zero tolerance for incomplete or incorrect implementations
- Final delivery must achieve 100% PRP compliance

Note: If any validation fails at any stage, immediately halt progress, analyze the failure against PRP specifications, implement fixes, and restart validation. Continue this cycle until perfect compliance is achieved.
