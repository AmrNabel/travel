      "question": "How does Mosafer work?",
      "answer": "Mosafer connects travelers with extra luggage space to people who need to send items. Travelers can post their trips and earn money by delivering items, while senders can find reliable travelers going their way."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Is it safe to send items with travelers?",
      "answer": "Yes! We have a rating and review system where users can rate each other after transactions. This helps build trust in our community. We recommend checking traveler profiles and ratings before sending items."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How much does it cost?",
      "answer": "The cost varies based on the item weight and the traveler's pricing. Travelers set their price per kilogram, and you can negotiate through our messaging system. It's typically much cheaper than traditional courier services."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What items can I send?",
      "answer": "You can send most items, but please avoid prohibited items like dangerous goods, illegal substances, or perishable food. Always communicate with the traveler about what you're sending to ensure they're comfortable carrying it."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How do I track my delivery?",
      "answer": "You can communicate directly with the traveler through our in-app messaging system. They can update you on the delivery status, and you'll receive notifications when the item is marked as delivered."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "What if something goes wrong?",
      "answer": "If there's an issue with your delivery, please contact us immediately through our support system. We have a dispute resolution process and will work to resolve any problems."
